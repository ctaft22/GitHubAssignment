Once upon a time there was a student at the University of Wisconsin Madison. They lived a normal night, doing school work 
during the day, and spending time with friends at night until one day everything changed. All of a sudden the students 
life turned upside down when they woke up with superpowers, and they were informed that it was their job to save not 
only Madison, but also the world.
